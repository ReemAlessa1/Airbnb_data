## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb open data to better understand:

1. What is the busiest time of the year to visit Seattle? by how much do prices spike?
2. What is the most expensive neighborhood in Seattle?
3. What is the neighborhood with the highest review scores in Seattle?
4. What is the feature that has the biggest effect on the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

To display work relevant to the questions above, there is one notebook available here. The notebook is exploratory, examining the information relevant to the questions. To make it easier to walk through the reasoning behind each step, markdown cells were employed.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://reemalessa1.github.io/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
