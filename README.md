## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3.* versions should allow the code to run without any problems.

Requierd packages:
- numpy 1.23.5

- matplotlib 3.8.2

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb open data to better understand:

1. What is the busiest time of the year to visit Seattle? by how much do prices spike?
2. What is the most expensive neighborhood in Seattle?
3. What is the neighborhood with the highest review scores in Seattle?
4. What is the feature that has the biggest effect on the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

To display work relevant to the questions above, there is one notebook available here. The notebook is exploratory, examining the information relevant to the questions. To make it easier to walk through the reasoning behind each step, markdown cells were employed.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The post that is published  [here](https://reemalessa1.github.io/) contains the primary conclusions of the code.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
